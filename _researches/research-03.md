This research explores novel methods for improving guitar tablature transcription by emphasizing
musical expression over mechanical efficiency. While traditional approaches often prioritize
minimizing finger movement and hand repositioning, this study aims to refine transcription
algorithms by integrating guitar-specific playing techniques. The goal is to create transcriptions
that better reflect the musical nuances of the guitar, balancing playability with a more authentic
and expressive representation of the music.

I am currently working on this research project as a part of my Master's degree in Music Technology.
