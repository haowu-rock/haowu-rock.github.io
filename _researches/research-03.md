This is my current Master’s thesis research. The overarching goal is to develop a guitar transcription system that converts music originally not composed for guitar into guitar tablature, such as transcribing a piano sonata into a rock-style guitar tab. Due to the unique nature of the guitar and the distinct characteristics of tablature— which focuses on finger arrangement and playing skill notations—this presents a challenging task. Additionally, since the source music is not originally intended for guitar, the transcription results may not have a single correct answer.

My current research explores novel methods for enhancing guitar tablature transcription by prioritizing musical expression over mechanical efficiency. While traditional approaches often focus on minimizing finger movement and hand repositioning, this study aims to refine transcription algorithms by integrating guitar-specific playing techniques. The goal is to create transcriptions that more accurately reflect the musical nuances of the guitar, balancing playability with a more authentic and expressive representation of the music.

Since I am currently working on this, I won’t reveal too many details about the implementation.

After completing my thesis, further research will be needed on music adaptation, difficulty adjustment, and melody extraction to contribute to the overall project.
