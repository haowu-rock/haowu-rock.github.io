I worked as a research assistant at Spatial Experiences Lab at Carnegie Mellon University during the summer break of 2024.

I implemented a DOA algorithm using two microphones to evaluate the results of auditory
perception experiments and calibrate the localization performance of the Wave Field Synthesis
(WFS) speaker array system. Participated in a perceptual experiment to measure the angle at
which localization becomes indistinguishable. Maintained a Max project for controlling the WFS
system and interacting with a motion tracking system.
