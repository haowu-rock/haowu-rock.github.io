This is the band's page on Spotify: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/45ZSxVFs1txonKgHR9D5vC" target="_blank">Devastation</a>

During my time with the band, we released two digital albums/EPs, performed over 60 live shows, and completed two tours in China. I was responsible for composing and producing demos for most of the songs.  

I was involved in the production of songs from the beginning up until the album *The Light The Origin*.

To prevent you from needing a Spotify subscription to listen, I’m posting three of the songs here.
