1.I implemented several effects for the guitar effects processor, including Compressor, Noise Gate, Reverb, Delay, Flanger, Chorus, Wah, Phaser, and Tremolo. Since the code is proprietary to the company, I can only share video recordings filmed in 2022, where I tested some of these algorithms in Logic Pro.

2.I independently developed the iOS version of the ArenaControl app-the wireless controlling app for Arena2000. It helps users to dial the parameters and change the signal
chain conveniently. Here is a video filmed in 2022 for testing the application along with the Arena2000 hardware.
